# CalcStats Test Design Kata

Write tests for the code. It should cover the functionality described in [Calculate Stats](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/calc_stats.html). There are several implementations of the same functionality, with slightly different challenges.

## CalcStats 1

This code contains well-marked bugs - if the input contains the number 42 then bad things happen. For each bug, write a test that fails. Remove the bug and make sure the test passes. At the end you should have 100% code coverage for CalcStats1.

## CalcStats 2
This exercise is similar to CalcStats1. The code contains well-marked bugs, but they are slightly subtler than for the previous exercise. The procedure is the same as before, For each bug, write a test that fails. Ensure the error message is useful and would help you to find the bug. Remove the bug and make sure the test passes. At the end you should have 100% code coverage for CalcStats2.

## CalcStats 3
For this exercise, you are given tests with good coverage. Look for bugs in this code. Why didn't the existing tests find them? For each bug you find, write a new test that fails. Ensure the error message is useful and would help you to find the bug. Remove the bug and make sure the test passes. 

When you think you have found all the bugs, come up with a new bug and put it in the code. If the tests do not fail, write a new test that does fail.

At the end you should still have 100% code coverage for CalcStats3, and your tests should find all the bugs you can think of.
