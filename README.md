# CalcStats Test Design Kata

Write tests for the code. It should cover the functionality described in [Calculate Stats](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/calc_stats.html). There are two implementations of the same functionality, write tests for both.

Start with the "happy path" main functionality then move on to edge cases. There are bugs in both implementations. Write tests that fail because of each bug. Make sure the test passes when you fix the bug and not otherwise.

This exercise could be used with this learning hour: [Three parts of a test](https://sammancoaching.org/learning_hours/test_design/three_parts_of_a_test.html)
